# Week 2 - Network Security

This week focused on understanding network-level security using packet analysis, port scanning, and traffic interpretation.

## ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered

- Deep dive into TCP/IP and OSI layers
- Common ports and network protocols
- Packet analysis with **Wireshark**
- Port scanning with **Nmap**
- Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Wireshark**
- **Nmap**
- **Netcat** (optional)

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `wireshark-analysis.md` | Observations from analyzing HTTP, DNS, FTP traffic |
| `nmap-scans.md`         | Port scan results and interpretations |
| `/screenshots/`         | Packet captures and scan outputs |

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Learned how to detect suspicious packets (e.g., unencrypted credentials)
- Understood how to identify open ports and fingerprint OS/services
- Practiced live network traffic capture and analysis
